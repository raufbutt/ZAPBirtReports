XmlReporterExtension.java shall be placed in "org\zaproxy\zap\extension"

In the alert folder, "ExtensionAlert.java" is changed so should be replaced accordingly in your alert folder.

"build-extension.xml" should be placed in the build folder of your ZAP setup.

Documentation folder contains the detailed documentation related to the work done for creating the extension of BIRT reports for ZAP.

birtreports folder should go in the extension folder of your ZAP setup.

Thanks
